Suggestions for improvement of DPPP, LoSoTo and other LOFAR-related software,
as conceived during PiLF development.

DPPP:
- Currently (Sept. 2017), DPPP exports ParmDB files, which can be converted into H5Parm files using
  Francesco's h5parm_importer.py. In the future, DPPP will export H5Parm files directly.
  DPPP should read the MS POLARIZATION subtable to read polarisation names (and not blindly assume
  that the polarisations are 'XX', 'XY', 'YX' and 'YY'). This is important for the uGMRT, which uses
  circular polarisation.
- DPPP should add the field name (e.g. '3C147') to the H5Parm file. This is useful for plotting in LoSoTo.

LoSoTo:
- The PiLF uGMRT-dedicated bandpass - TEC separator program should be incorporated in LoSoTo as a function.

PiLF:
- Logged text currently looks ugly, because of color coding pre- and suffixes added to logging expressions.
  This color coding looks great on the command line, but a system should be devised where the color coding
  is not added for stored text files.
- Documentation should be written to explain the code structure of PiLF for future developers.
